## Last Week's Accomplishments

try to get yacs working


    
## This Week's Plan

get yacs fixed, finish presentation slides

working on 409


## Anything Blocking?

virtual machine for win10 home stop working, cannot get yacs running. Just figuired out this is window's problem on Wedsnday night meeting, 
trying to dual boot linux instead of using vm instead. Probably cannot finish 409 before presentation, but is going to keep working on it anyway.
