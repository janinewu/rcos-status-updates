## Last Week's Accomplishments

Working on issue #401 https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/401

Tried a lot of approaches, which looked terrible. After meeting on Wedsnday, decide to use a different design strategy and is working on it.

    
## This Week's Plan

Get #401 solved hopefuly, and find a small issue which can be solved before spring break.


## Anything Blocking?

Getting used to using HTML and css. Making good design
