Working on presentation slides, talking with the group about what we should present and who is going for what.

working on 409, redesigning schedual view, get the redesign for calender working. However, the existing design that has been
made is really not fitting well the rest of the yasc. Talked with Ada about this, checking some design rules,
trying to made some redesign, try new colors and new styles

    
## This Week's Plan

Get presentation done, 

keep working on 409: make new design


## Anything Blocking?

Trying the make yacs more colorful. However, in order for the colorful calender to work, the sidebar and courses should be colorful
as well, or it just look terriable.
