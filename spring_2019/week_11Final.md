## This Week's Plan

Pushing everything to my repository, especially the working version of schedual redesign

Summing up for the semester


## Notes


Since the part for redesigning schedual view is not done yet. I pushed it to my repository (https://github.com/janinewu/yacs.git) and did put a pull request just to show what I have done with it. The stuff there works, but it just does not look right with the rest of the yacs.

calender redesign: the current design for the calender

When thinking about schedual view redesign, we take into accound both calender redesign and sidebar redesign. The part I am
working on is calender redesign. I like the round corner but that does not fit our design strategy. At the same time, I do like
the side boarder in the old design. I kind of want to change the color for the existing redesign since it pops out too much
with the exisiting version of yacs. And it is just too colorful without anything supporting it. I am thinking about adding something
to the surrounding to make it fits in.
But, we are planning on doing a sidebar redesign as well. Hopefull, with the completion of 
sidebar redesign (making it more colorful as well), the calender can look right. Also, I talked with Ada, and are thinging about
adding colors to the school view and when we select a course (which color will match with the color in the calender).


calender redesign with sidebar: hopefully can get the sidebar color to match the block color in the calender

This is my first time doing rcos and first time in yacs. I spent some time get yacs working and fix issues with getting it running
properly. I learned many about html, css and ts this year. I haveb been working on implementing the exisitng logo (top left on the 
home page) and doing a school view redesign (make it a card style instead of a list style).
