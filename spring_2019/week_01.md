## Last Week's Accomplishments

Finally get everything worked in my virtual box.



## This Week's Plan

Got myself assigned to an issue. https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/366
Have a lot of things do during the weekend, so probably will start working on it since Monday, and hopefuly can get it done by next Friday.

## Anything Blocking?

Problems with linux in virtual box. Cannot get sublime installed, cannot see the application menu(solved during small group meeting in Friday)
