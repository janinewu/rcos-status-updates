## This Week's Plan

Pushing everything to my repository, especially the working version of schedual redesign

Summing up for the semester


## Notes

Since the part for redesigning schedual view is not done yet. I pushed it to my repository (https://github.com/janinewu/yacs.git) and did put a pull request just to show what I have done with it. The stuff there works, but it just does not look right with the rest of the yacs.

When thinking about schedual view redesign, we take into accound both calender redesign and sidebar redesign. The part I am
working on is calender redesign. I kind of want to change the color for the existing redesign since it pops out too much
with the exisiting version of yacs. But, we are planning on doing a sidebar redesign as well. Hopefull, with the completion of 
sidebar redesign (making it more colorful as well), the calender can look right. Also, I talked with Ada, and are thinging about
adding colors to the school view and when we select a course (which color will match with the color in the calender).
